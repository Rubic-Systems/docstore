# April 2024 Progress Report

## Project Status: KPI Analysis Platform
**Status**: Planning Phase
**Report Date**: April 25, 2024

### Project Overview
Development of a web-based KPI analysis platform to replace current manual Computrek system. The project aims to automate data collection, provide real-time analytics, and enhance business intelligence capabilities for automotive service shops.

### Current Phase
Initial Planning and Team Formation
- Development team identified: Chris 'Tico' Antico and Arthur Jin
- Initial architecture and development approach defined
- Test implementation partner identified (Smart Service)

### Achievements
1. **Project Structure Defined**
   - Three-phase development approach established:
     - Demo Phase (2 months)
     - MVP Phase (3-6 months)
     - Production Phase (18 months)
   - Clear milestones and deliverables outlined for each phase

2. **Technical Architecture Planning**
   - Core technology stack decisions made:
     - Redux for state management
     - Data cube implementation for efficient data handling
     - Cloud-based architecture with API integration
     - Scalability support for hundreds of thousands of users

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Initial focus on Tech-Metrics system integration
   - Smart Service identified as primary test implementation partner
   - Two-location testing environment secured

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **Mobile Development**
   - Challenge: Need for mobile access vs development complexity
   - Solution: Phased approach with initial mobile-responsive web app, dedicated mobile features in later phases

2. **System Integration**
   - Challenge: Multiple shop management systems in use
   - Solution: Focus on single system (Tech-Metrics) for initial phases, expand integration in production phase

3. **Data Access**
   - Challenge: Need for real shop data for development
   - Solution: Partnership with Smart Service for test implementation

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate Actions (Next 2 Weeks)**
   - Finalize contracts and agreements
   - Set up development environment
   - Begin demo phase planning

2. **Short Term (2 Months)**
   - Complete demo phase development
   - Implement basic authentication
   - Create simple KPI dashboard
   - Develop data cube operations

3. **Medium Term (3-6 Months)**
   - Progress to MVP phase
   - Implement full core functionality
   - Complete Tech-Metrics integration
   - Develop mobile-responsive features

### Resource Allocation
- Development Team: 2 engineers
- Initial Phase Budget: Reduced rate for demo phase
- Infrastructure: Local hosting for demo/MVP phases

### Risk Assessment
1. **Technical Risks**
   - API integration complexity
   - Data volume handling
   - System scalability

2. **Business Risks**
   - Timeline dependencies
   - Resource availability
   - Market adoption readiness
