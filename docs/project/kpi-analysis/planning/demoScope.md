# Auto Repair Center KPI Analysis Platform - Demo Phase Scope

## Overview

The Demo phase (Phase 1) aims to create a functional prototype that demonstrates core capabilities and secures investor confidence. This phase will focus on building the foundation of the platform with essential features, including a basic data cube implementation with real auto repair shop data.

## Timeline

- Duration: 2 months
- Focus: Core functionality demonstration
- Team: 2 Full-time Engineers

## Core Features

### Data Integration

- Live API integration with auto repair shop system
- Historical data access and processing
- Basic data validation and transformation layer
- Real-time data querying capabilities

### Data Cube Structure

- Three core dimensions:
  - Time (hourly granularity)
  - Service Type (supporting 30+ types initially, expandable to hundreds)
  - Technician (individual level)
- Support for flexible aggregations
- Time window modifications
- Basic trend analysis capabilities

### KPI Framework

- Generic, extensible KPI system supporting:
  - Percentages
  - Counts
  - Averages
  - Ratios
- KPI metadata system including:
  - Descriptions
  - Formulas
  - Target values
- Support for multiple KPI types and calculations

### User Interface

- Basic responsive web application
- Simple user authentication
- Raw data tables with aggregations
- Basic charting capabilities
- Focus on results display rather than operations
- Basic dashboard layout

### Data Management

- Direct integration with shop API
- Local data caching and management
- Basic database schema
- Simple aggregation operations (SUM, AVG, etc.)

### Technical Implementation

#### Frontend (Engineer 1 Focus)

- JavaScript implementation
- Material-UI components integration
- Basic state management
- Simple data visualization with Recharts
- Basic authentication flow
- Results-focused data display components

#### Backend (Engineer 2 Focus)

- Node.js + Express.js API setup
- PostgreSQL database implementation
- Shop API integration
- Authentication system
- Basic data cube engine (simple aggregations)
- KPI calculation engine

#### Infrastructure (Shared Responsibility)

- AWS cloud setup
- Docker containerization
- Basic security implementation

### Demo Capabilities

1. User Authentication

   - Simple login/registration
   - Basic user profiles

<!-- 2. Dashboard

   - Basic KPI display
   - Sample data visualization
   - Simple data cube operations

3. Data Management
   - Manual data entry
   - Basic data storage
   - Basic data cube operations:
     - Simple slicing (by time, service type)
     - Basic aggregations (sum, average)
     - Simple drill-down capability -->

## Success Criteria

- Functional prototype with core features
- Successful integration with shop API
- Demonstration of flexible aggregations
- Working KPI framework
- Basic trend analysis capabilities
- Core technology stack validation
- Initial data model validation
- Basic data cube functionality demonstrated

## Technical Deliverables
