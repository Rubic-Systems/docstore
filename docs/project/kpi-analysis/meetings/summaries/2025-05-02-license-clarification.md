## Decisions Made

1. Dave will have non-exclusive, perpetual rights to use the platform, with source code transfer if contract ends or Rubic is acquired
   - Rationale: Protect client interests and ensure business continuity
   - Impact: Legal contract to reflect this, Rubic to provide support for transition if needed
2. Rubic will provide support to Dave, but Dave will support his own end users
   - Rationale: Standard SaaS/white-label practice
   - Impact: Dave to set up internal support process, Rubic to handle escalations

## Next Steps

1. Chris to send meeting summary and bullet points to legal counsel
2. Dave to contact TechMetric for API/demo access
3. Legal review and contract drafting
4. Schedule next meeting after legal feedback
