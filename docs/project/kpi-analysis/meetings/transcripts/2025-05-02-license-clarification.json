There's a subconscious thing, and here comes Arthur now. But there's a subconscious thing that controls the difference of where you close your windpipe off when you swallow, and that. And as I get older it's like there's some mistiming of that, and I'm doing more sometimes drinking something. I'll breathe in a little bit of what I'm drinking, because it didn't shut it off and that I asked my doctor, I go. Is it possible that, like the seal is broken or something, and you know, needs a new gasket, and he goes. No, it's just as you get older sometimes that rhythm and timing the the muscle there that moves it might be a little bit slower, so it's not as quick as it used to be is what he said. Interesting. Yeah, anyway. Good morning, Arthur. You got right in the middle of a conversation about body fluids."

You know where you guys have the code. And at the same time I also have to look at scenarios that a possibilities. you know, we're building a a bond in in a relationship, business and friendship of trust. And I don't believe there's ever gonna be any kind of a clash of anything. And at some point, if by chance. you know, you guys build this robust software and no, take that back. Not if when you build it and it becomes marketable. And then all of a sudden, you get an offer from somebody that wants to pay 1015, $2050,000,000, 100 million dollars for your software and you decide to sell it? Where does that leave compute? What? What does that leave? If something happens? that you guys decide as a development company? Hey? We want to go. Do this now, and you know, where does that leave us? As far as having access to that? In that, he said."

      "text": "I think it largely depends on whether or not you guys would ever want to host the Source code yourself. If if at any point there was a buyout. It's it's not particularly difficult to add a clause in the contract that says, if for any reason this contract is to be ended in any capacity. You get a copy of the Source Code for your own internal use. Now, there's no payments to anyone. You're not paying some 3rd party big buyout. Microsoft buys us. And now you're trying to negotiate contracts with Microsoft. No, you just get a copy of the code. Now, that would require that you now are transitioning into a software company. You would need to set up the servers and get the engineers so that they can hook the thing together, but largely the development is done. It would just be the maintenance of the tool and making sure that it's hooked up and plugged in correctly. But there is, if if that is to be avoided, if you don't want to go down that route and say like, No, I want this to perpetually be a software as a service, but I need to guarantee or lock in some sort of rates in the way that that could be structured. Pardon me, because I'm speaking from a little bit of a position of ignorance here. But I think the way that that could be structured is that there's a locked cost for what you're paying for the usage of this tool. and that it's always we are paying for the overhead that we are paying for right for you right like. So the server fees, and then the server storage and the content distribution network, and that kind of thing so like whatever that number is, is what you are are paying us. and if there was a revenue split, then that ends when the when the company dissolves or gets acquired, or anything like that, and then you are just paying the base level minimum costs. Now that becomes a little bit difficult to enforce, because you don't have visibility into what the costs are. We are doing this relationship from a position of trust. If we say, Hey, it's costing us a dollar 27 per client that you're bringing in per day for the storage fees. You you kind of have to take our word for it like we can show you the numbers. No problem. But if this becomes a 3rd party, if a company buys us out. I don't know if there's any other way than for you to just kind of take it at face value that they say that this is what the cost is."

      "speaker": "Dave Schedin",

      "text": "Right. Well, at that point I would assume we'd have some history with you of knowing what true costs are, and all of a sudden trip, or something that you know, that would, you know, justify? Show us, you know. How did that happen, or whatever I just wanna ensure that I want to ensure number number 1st and foremost, I want to ensure the win-win scenario number 2. I want to ensure that in that win win scenario that if something happens, a parting of ways, whatever context that is that we at some level get like you said a copy of that source code. Now, granted. We're then responsible for hosting and doing all the logistics that makes that code work and that I would. I would want at least to have that I'd almost wanna. And I'm gonna just paint my picture perfect world. What I think would be a win for us. I would rather not go down that road if I don't have to. You know I would rather have perpetual license of that, whether it's you own the company or you sell the company, but I know that that puts a hindrance on you selling the company because they it already comes with not necessarily a liability, but it would come with maybe an income stream at least to cover those costs, or whatever.

We're selling you the chicken so you can sell the eggs to your customers. so you will have your own copy of the Chicken should you want it. So if you, if you don't want to use our version of the chicken. You have access to the code. and then you can deploy the chicken in order to sell the eggs or use our chicken to sell the eggs. but the non exclusive here is, you're not supposed to give other people the chicken. You can give them the eggs all you want, just not not the chicken."

I mean, it's gonna have our logo and everything on it. These are compete reports, copy check reports. And I also part of my income stream is, I want to build a platform where I can. Then they would never have access to the code or any of that, but I train an automotive coach, and now they can brand it, replace the competition logo with their logo, and it's now their license to use it through me, and I'm training them, and part of their training package means they have access to this, and whenever they have a client on it. They're paying me a stipend off of what they're charging their client for it. But I want to be able to take that. So the compute track version of the Cts portal, including the future modules we want to develop. I'm gonna be able to brand it with another coach's logo and have it as like a sub. Pardon me, or whatever. I'm not sure how you need to, how that would be structured. But."

And then you sell the chicken to somebody else that they have their own version of the software as a service platform that they're going to sell to their own their own coaches. That that would be like, okay. So so that's when this would be a transferable license as opposed to a non transferable license, because you want to be able to take the source code and give it to them. But if that's not what you're actually describing, you're saying, we want to have the chicken just put it in different cartons, so that everybody has their different Logos, so that they can sell it to the people. And that's actually exactly as we understood what it is that you guys are trying."

So yeah, I I think it all makes sense that I'm just trying to think of the questions we had and did it line up with the answers like, I said, if something happens, we're able to walk away with the code ourselves and run it on our own. And I think Dave just kind of put the biggest. The biggest thing was was, you know, I think we're gonna have a long, lasting trust relationship together. But you know, it would be foolish if someone offered you guys whatever 10 million dollars for your product. you know. And what does that look like to us? Because a lot of those times. really, this is what we typically see. We've seen in the industry. Over and over, right these great Softwares are built on a passion project, a passion to serve, a passion, to like the excitement some other company buys it for the big payout and they turn around. They just go. Okay. Now it's time to cut all the costs, all the fluff."

      "text": "Okay, well, how how about? I explicitly ask the lawyer to include a buyout clause of some sort which gets triggered if we ever get bought out, or something happens of that nature that says that you get an immediate transfer of whatever the state of the source code is at that point. And so that way, you guys have the copy of whatever it is that we're doing immediately before any buyout, you know, goes through. And that would be something that you guys could go through the process of deploying. I'll even Arthur and I would. Probably, you know, if we're we're taking the the buyout money. Maybe we would come, deploy it for you guys or something like that. Right? And so then you have your own internal compute version of the tool that we built as a service. That's now just an in-house tool that you guys have. It would largely be identical. The only thing that would change is probably the URL that people would log into, and that would be the only difference."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Dave Schedin",
      "timestamp": "00:16:04",
      "text": "Right, and so there I would. I would probably, if if in that agreement is is like. When I sold my shop I had a I wanted it very short. Most of them are usually a a year long non-compete consulting agreement. Where you stay when you sell a business. The key operator stays with the business for 12 months to make sure the transition is good, I opt for just 30 days, and that but the same type of deal. Maybe we have. If that happens, we source code is transferred. And for whatever fee seems reasonable at the time you guys help us platform it whether you guys can want to continue to run it. We make that agreement then great, or you train somebody that we want to have in charge of it, or whatever. But then there would be a negotiable. you know, training at at current pricing, or whatever that you guys would train our people to run it so in a sense, hopefully, it would be smooth, seamless, and transition. And that so I mean I I I mean I as I'm looking at the entrepreneurial opportunity here. you know the not only other vertical markets, but you guys are more global than I am. I mean, my global capacity is like Canada. you know. And you guys are, you know, you've you've got other sites in this industry where it could take it. Now. the other, the other realm is that as we talked last time, and I want to bring a little bit more clarity to it. Actually, before I go there did was did what I say. Do you have any questions, or does that make sense? How I said that? That's something you think you can approach the lawyer to have them draw that up and."

There are 2 different conditions. The 1st one is the Rubik system. The company Chris and I created were bought out. The second scenario is the the product we created or in the in the analogy is the chicken. The chicken we we created is bought out. That's gonna result in different consequences. And consider, considering what we are trying to do, the collaboration we're trying to do here. Here's how it works. Chris and I create a chicken, and then we make a we make a copy of the chicken, and then cause they've Mike you mentioned that you don't want to take charge of any of the operations business related to the related to to hosting hosting the app. That means you actually want want to have the copy, chicken, and let Chris and I to keep the chicken for you. but as a re as a return to cover the cost of of of feeding this chicken. When you sell the eggs you're gonna you're gonna split some part of the revenue to Chris and I to cover our cost for your chicken."

But the idea is that we probably do not have the capacity to go to venture capitalists and stay in charge of this project until we have something like an Mvp. Completed. So at the minimum, if it is us who are going for venture capital funding. We would need to reach the end of the Mvp. Stage in order to have something like the proof of concept to be able to show to venture capitalists to say, Look what we've built, and we have a client, and we have a market, and we have a guy who's going to be doing marketing. That would wow them, they would say, absolutely, here's the funding. You can stay in charge of the project. Then that would mean that you don't need to worry about paying for the 3rd part, and because the usage agreement is already in place. you kind of don't need to do anything at that point, you just get the end product that we have, and whatever agreements that we have for building additional cup holders is, you know how we would execute making changes or modifications to the system."

And so if the value in the spreadsheet is something that's already in the shop management system, there is no data entry at all. It's like you plug them in, you turn it on.

Well, then, this system will only work from the day you turn it on. But that's kind of like what we do during the demo and the Mvp. Is, we find out like, oh, it turns out that the Api does not contain historical values, and they're only containing, like the current state. For, like what it is today, in which case we need to then copy that value into today's date. And then the next day we get a new value. We copy that into the next day's date, and you can't go backwards from there, and that would require manual entry. But we won't know that until we're in the mid Demo slash early Mvp stage, when we're using this with the real Api, and we say, like, Oh, this is what this looks like for this shop management system."

We need to be issued that key by techmetric in order to do work that's largely not something that you need to worry about. I would reach out to techmetric and say, Hey, I'm a developer. I'm building a tool for your application. Do you have a demo database that I could use? Can I have an Api key so that I can get data from it. And if they say, Yes, I say, Okay, thank you for this. But actually, I have got a real client with real data that I would like to use. I have permission from dynamic Diesel to use their data. Can I have an Api key for their specific endpoint? And then techmetric would give me the key so that I can siphon the data from dynamic Diesel. Having the Api does not give me the ability to write into their database. It only gives us the ability to read from it. So there's no danger of us like corrupting their database, or anything like that."

And this was a problem for protractor. Because protractor only gives you today's data, it doesn't give you all of the data. And so if somebody were to update the phone number on an old customer service intelligence wouldn't see it, because that was outside of the data range that protractor was giving us in our case. I don't think that matters because we're not looking for customer specific metrics. We might not even care about like, what's the content of the of the message, although there's arguments to be said like, maybe you have, Kpis, for how verbose are your messages? Because if you have really short messages at one location. Maybe that's important, and that's a Kpi you want to track. But anyhow, getting off topic I'm pretty sure that this works the way my assumption is, which is that we have access to all the historical data, and like overnight, if this, if we get the Kpi working, it'll work for the entire history that they have data inside of the shop management system."

And and so our our org chart would be significantly smaller and have significantly fewer positions in it. especially since we don't particularly need marketing.

I just have them give me some manual entry minor things, but I know that. Then it's inside of their system that we need. We could go get some really good stuff. And so the dispatching tool with AI built in. you know that's gonna be huge, you know, and and you're talking like you go to a a trucking company or a a a plumbing company that's got 40 50 trucks. And what kind of job are they on? How long is that job? Typically take and blah blah? And now you can. You have this AI generated dispatching. This is the best practice for the same thing with technicians. Every tech's a different speed, every tech. You know, they do different jobs. And now we have historical data. Whenever this tech does a Bmw. On a ford, it takes them this long Bmw. On a ford, a water pump on a Ford. That it takes them this long and then but this tech, it takes them longer to do that one. And so when he has that job, we reserve this amount of time. So we know the text next available time is that, anyway, that's another whole venture. But but if once we get you know the competition model up. And now you take Rubik systems and you go to market to a different vertical market.

This is kind of like base cts is done. I've got this really cool idea for a cup holder. I want this dispatching system. It's not part of the current scope. It's not part of the part of the current plan. It's not covered by the current budget. What would it take to build this comprehensive dispatching system so that it's embedded and integrated and works within your system. I am not sure what that would look like. but what I can say is that the project that we are undertaking as it is, is complex enough that I want to see success for this project first, st before. I'm particularly concerned about what it looks like to add cup holders to this project that said, I think it's actually a really good idea that these types of things that we build inside of your Cts system enhance the chicken that we are building in general. because a dispatching system is not unique to automotive. Only it just happens to be that that's where we're building it. And so once again, we're in the exact same position that we are building the Cts system. This is like, well, this is a brilliant idea, and we absolutely should build this because it'll make a better system. And it's easier for us to sell the chicken eggs. Yeah. So so the eggs later on to other people. Because as a software, as a service platform, we don't want to give away the source code to other people. We don't want to give them copies of our chicken. We we just want to print eggs, put them in shiny cartons with their logo and say, Yeah, not only does this Carton have all these eggs in it. It's got a couple there on the side.

You want one for compute. dispatch, and then compute track, kpi analysis, or whatever you know, whatever those 2 are called, and that those can be turned on or installed separately, they can be purchased separately. They have, you know. Maybe it's the same user account where you log into the back end to update your credit card or whatever that looks like, but largely for the front end.

After this meeting I need access to the recording so that I can convert the transcript into a bullet point of actionable items. I need to send that to the lawyer, and so, theoretically, within an hour of getting that from you, I should be able to send off the email, since it's late on a Friday. Not that late, but late enough that they're probably not going to have anything done. I will reach out to them if they have not sent me an email or given me a call by Monday morning. Monday morning is, hey? I sent you an email on Friday. Did you see it? Do you have any questions, and are you working on it? What does it look like to make sure that we're entered into a contract on that call? I will try to get an actual date from them, for when they expect to have this completed I can give that date to you as soon as I get it. But my assumption is that they need one or 2 days since Arthur did some pretty hefty research into what is the business model that we're actually doing. And he found, oh, this is white label software. As a service. There's actually a lot of precedent for this. It turns out that we're not inventing something from scratch here in terms of what the business model is. The only thing that's a bit unique. Here is the source code assignment. So there's actually pre written documents for this type of thing. I don't think that they need to write this from scratch, and so I'm expecting they should have a turnaround time in one or 2 days. Of course, that's total assumption on my point on my part. I have no idea what the lawyer will do, but I can make it clear to them. My client is waiting on this documents, and every minute that we wait is another minute that I don't have put a fire under. Ass. Get this done. which I think is reasonable for me to do, because they they're charging like $700 an hour. So Once. Once we have the documents from the lawyer, I will send it to you to you immediately. I don't think there's needs to be any revision. The only way that that would be slowed down is if the lawyer looks at our notes or the bullet point summary from this meeting and says, Well, wait a sec. You guys didn't discuss XY and Z, in which case then, we'd have to do another iterative, iterative cycle of feedback. But there are 2 things that I need to discuss with you, Arthur, and I want to take a vacation. We've been going at breakneck speed 16 h days for the last 4 months. and so we want to take a week off. That does not mean that I'm not going to push things with the lawyer. It just means that if we if you sign the agreement tomorrow, we we still wouldn't start until a week from then, because that's fine. Do you guys, my wife."

So there is one undiscussed thing that I'm not exactly sure how to resolve, but I know that we are in opposition as far as how this should be done, and that is tech support for your end users. because typically software as a service is done where we do tech support for the person that we have sold the chicken to. But we don't necessarily do tech support for the people that you are selling the eggs to. And so that would typically at least the standard in the industry would be that if you are buying the white label service from us to sell the eggs to your customers, you are the one responsible for supporting the carton and the eggs and the logo on there, and that kind of thing. And so, if your end users, like the actual shop, have a question about the metrics, saying, Why, why does it show this number? What does that mean? Call would typically be fielded by you? And then the support that we are doing is more like dev support. There's a bug on the page, or a screen doesn't render properly, or it's missing this number, or this doesn't make sense, you know. Explain the math to me. That that's the type of support that we would do for you, which is totally different than tech support for your end users. We we really do not want to do tech support for your end users. I recognize we are not in a position to make demands of that kind of thing. So this is, this is kind of like we're imagining. Further on down the road the full production product is ready and it's launched. We have our own internal support team, but they're supporting the products that's being sold to you, and not necessarily the usage of the product by your end users. And so that would require having, like a special dedicated person for just you, that wouldn't be able to provide support for any of the other customers that we have, because we certainly wouldn't structure an agreement with any further people that we do business with to do support for their end users."

It is a core tenant of of what we're trying to build is something that helps transform the way you see the world."

And I've noticed that what I speak with the phone off when I turn on Facebook, I get ads for that or videos around that. So I'm going, you know Rubik system. That's kind of cool. I wonder if you had to pay a license fee for the word Rubik, or is that, anyway? But then I'm said, I said Rubik out loud about 3 or 4 times next time I log into Facebook, you know what I get. I get videos of kids doing the Rubik's thing, and like 30 seconds, this one kid. he took 3 Rubik's cubes that are jumbled and he has 5 min. It was a world record was to beat 5 min. He's juggling them, and every time he catches them he turns them in his hands, and he does it in under 5 min he gets all 3 cubes solved."
